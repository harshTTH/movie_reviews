Title Review:

In my perspective, 1994 was a year to remember for movie buffs like us. First of all it gave us Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, The Lion King, and finally this young independent "new generation" awesome "Quentin Tarantino" trademark film - Pulp Fiction. This is film is, if I just had one word to describe, "Cooool!". Well, and second, it marked the arrival of a new kind of cinema into the industry with an overwhelming response. Quentin Tarantino marked his arrival as well and since then there's no turning back.

The style adapted by his films have always been unique - modern, savage life, though filled with a lot of violence, filthy mouths, and no soft corners. This is the way America has progressed throughout, and his films are a nearly correct portrayal. The story is based on two mobsters who face a sequence of events on a job one fine day, that ultimately their perspectives get affected by what they do (not necessary for all, cause it's Tarantino guys!).

It is both witty and humorous in its own ways. String performances by Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel (though he had a cameo but still he was awesome!). The film righteously won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino) and Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival. It is a delightful watch especially for the youth. I'm giving it 81% because of its memorable nature and spellbound portrayals and expressions.

Title Score: 81%
