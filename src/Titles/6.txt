Title Review:

What to say about David Fincher's Fight Club, it speaks for itself. David Fincher has been one director who has always inspired me with his unique style of film making. He always brings out something shown in such a way you can't expect it to be shown. This film's USP is the character Tyler Durden (awesomely portrayed by Brad Pitt), who loves vandalism, hates the orthodox methods of living, and sees everything his way, which any one of us even in their wildest of dreams can't even imagine of thinking! Literally, once you see it you'll get to know this.

The movie is quite humorous in its own ways, if you got the point of all the events narrated in a very complex and non - linear and non - traditional David Fincher fashion. The film is filled heaps of Tyler Philosophy which you are gonna appreciate as soon as you get it. The key is the style here. With some great performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Jared Leto and Helena Bonham Carter, Fight Club is not only a modern epic but it is a fictional theory which everyone (especially the youth) would want to live their lives like.

A must watch, especially if you low or cheated. An all time favorite goes with an 86% score.

Title Score: 86%
