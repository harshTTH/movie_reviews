Title Review:

I'll tell you my personal experience for my love for cinema, the reason behind it all is this film! This is one review I took the most time to write, because I was literally blown away by this film. It is simple yet complex, slow paced yet deeply moving, forward yet backward, plain yet smart, and crime drama yet art! The screenplay is one of the best I've witnessed ever. I believe this was Al Pacino's best acting performance ever throughout his career. The film won six Oscars including Best Picture (became the first film series (duology) to win Best Picture Oscar for both the films), Best Director (this time Coppola nailed it!), Best Screenplay (again!), Best Music, Original Score (it will literally blow you with its mightiness), and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro just killed it all, and that too in Italian (became the first actor to win an Oscar for a performance in a foreign language)).

A complex narration between the lives and time lines of Vito Corleone's early days in New York and Michael Corleone's empire in the New York City and many major parts America of the 1950's. With it's ultimate art at the end it comes very near to my heart. I even liked it more that its much hyped first part.

All and all, a great collection to watch based on the cult novel with the same title by Mario Puzzo, this film is a gem. I've not seen such a film, and I don't want you even to miss it. It's a real pleasure, and I'm giving it a 91% score from my end.

Title Score: 91%
