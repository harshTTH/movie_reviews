Title Review:

Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one heck of a movie to remember for a long time (in general, for person's life span!). The background score by Ennio Morricone, will leave you humming it all day and the Western world created by Leone will make you wish to be a cowboy! The film, though made in the mid 1960's still possesses an unmatched technical excellence, the cinematography, the art direction, the acting, everything is just perfect!

You will certainly fall for Clint Eastwood's awesomeness and Eli Wallach's slavishness which always brings out a humor to every bit of the film. Though a western adventure film, it still manages to unveil Americas dark past, the Civil War, in a very unique Sergio kind of a way. And yet it is artistic enough to appreciate it's beauty. The screenplay is way too good and the performances are a new upper bound. This film has always been a childhood partner for everyone (if not all, almost all). It is a rare piece of cinema which inspired many to make such kind of films, always in a will to reach it but every time way too far.

Every bit of it is enjoyable and it is a must watch especially for the newbies. I'm signing off with a 90% score for this film. It's a treat guys, trust me!

Title Score: 90%
