Title Review:

This is a gigantic epic in my and almost everyone's perspective, whether aged or young, girl or boy, everyone just loves Forrest Gump! If you miss this one, you really missed the best of movies. This certainly is the best picture of 1994 even after competing with giants like The Shawshank Redemption, The Lion King and Pulp Fiction, and suitably won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay (Eric Roth), Best Film Editing and Best Visual Effects (they were so seamless that you won't believe they were there in the film, and that's the beauty!).

This is the story of a mentally retard, low IQ person, Forrest Gump, and world from his point of view, shown so innocently and adorably. I can bet it can cheer you up from any mood, and you're gonna spread happiness by recommending this once you experience it yourself! His life journey is shown from his own perspective and is so humorous that you won't be able to control your laughter, every bit of it! And, yet it very smartly portrays the real life challenges that everyone faces and the attitude that one must possess to tackle problems. Goodness and Innocence are not just two terms found in books, they should be prominent enough to be noticed.

This film is, if I sum it up, a real gem which I don't think can ever be found again. This film is my love and will always be and I can bet you if you see it, you're gonna feel the same. A must must watch for everyone, I would rather say "An N time watch"! I'll give it 94% score and stop myself from writing any further, because I know I won't stop.

Title Score: 94%
