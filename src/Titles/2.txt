Title Name: The Godfather (1972)

Title One-Liner: An Offer you can't refuse!

Title Review:

If cinema is a religion, then Fracis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (the series) may be viewed as a cathedral. Not to offend anyone, I just wanted to convey it's grandness in the world of movies. Almost all of the modern crime - dramas are more or less inspired from this epic. With cult status, great acting performances, and a great storyline from the mafia genre master Mario Puzzo, this adapted screenplay is one to be kept in a museum.

The film revolves around the protagonist cum antagonist Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino), and his powerful family in New York City in the mid 1940's just after the World War II had finished. Michael's father Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), currently the head of the Corleone family, somehow gets into some trouble and situations turn up that way that Michael, who in the first place never wanted his hands to get dirty, gets into this family stuff. Things get creepy, and the story gets more complex as we move forward.

The film received three Oscars, Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzzo and Francis Ford Coppola). I feel that the Best Director Oscar should have gone to Francis Ford Coppola, as he deserved it in every sense. Extremely amazing performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert DuVall (played the character of Tom Hagen, my personal "all - time" favorite)

For all the Hollywood classic lovers this is a must watch, even the youth will like this epic. It's slow at some points but at the end every thing is justified, because Coppola made you an offer you can't refuse! I'm gonna go with 88% for this classic.

Title Score: 88%
