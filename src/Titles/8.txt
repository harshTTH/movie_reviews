Title Review:

This film, Whiplash, marks the entry of a giant into the industry, Damien Chazelle, the director of this film. It shows you a lot of philosophy about life, show how hard it is to be successful and earn a name, that success no piece of cake.

It deals with the life of a young boy, Andrew Neimann, an aspiring drummer artist, and his teacher, Terence Fletcher. It is portrayed so beautifully, that you will be spellbound, I was! Great performance by J.K. Simmons as Fletcher, which ultimately fetched him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role! The film won three Oscars in all, for Film Editing and Sound Mixing.

So simply it tells you that no one is good enough and to become one, you need a lot of dedication. That yes, there will be pot holes in your way, but you're not gonna stop. Even if you bleed, you won't stop. Till you get there! Even Miles Teller's portrayal of Andrew is amazing. It shows how much your parents care for you whether you know it or not, whether they show you or not, and whether you appreciate them or not!

This review is progressing in a manner that the film is an emotional drama, no it's not! It is a hard slap on the faces of all those who think they are only one's who're gonna get successful. I recommend everyone to watch this film, as it is really a masterpiece in all sense. I'm giving it a 92% movie score, cause it ain't worth less than that, believe me!

Title Score: 92%
